Goal: Build an app that determines the best region for new heardquarters
  - want to build in an area where the fish are low in calories and fat

API: https://github.com/theabr-org/coding-challenge-server
  - 

Reqs:
  - Fetch data from the code challenge server
  - NAV BAR with links to each page
  - HOME PAGE contains
    - list of each NOAAFisheriesRegion from the data set
      - each must show the average calories and fat per serving for fish in the region
  - Page for each region containing
    - Name of the region
    - Average calories and fat/serving for fish in that region
    - List of fish from the region
      - Name of fish
      - Image
      - calories and fat / serving
      - description text


Tasks: 
✔ 1. Play with the api and see what kind of data we're getting 
2. Get basic structure set up
  - Get nav bar working 
  - come back to this later to make it look nice
✔ 3. Make API call on home page
✔  - think about whether we can just pass this info down to the other pages or if we should make api calls for each page
4. Create components
  - Average calories and fat component
    - Will take a list of fish and calculate the average calories and fat and return it in a presentable manner
  - Fish Table component
    - Will take a list of fish and map them to components which have the name/image/nutrition/description info
5. ?? if finished with above re-evaluate

API response processing:
1. Make the api call
2. We need the fisheries separated by region so go through api response adding all regions to a set
  - For this challenge there will only be a set amount of regions but thinking for the future might be nice to dynamically make
  the nav bar etc
